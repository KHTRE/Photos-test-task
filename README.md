# Photos test task
- [DEMO LINK](https://khtre.github.io/Photos-test-task/)

## Important comments
- jsonplaceholder.typicode.com does not allow to actually delete anything. That is why after reload all the pictures are still in place. All we can see is a response in the console.
- jsonplaceholder.typicode.com does not have endpoint witch would give us a list of all albums. That is why I had to get all the data from the server and then get the list of albums. Therefore I did not use server side pagination and filter - it is useless if you already have all the data.
